                I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning. My background in Mining Engineering and Economics has equipped me with analytical thinking and a structured approach to challenges. Through courses with Cisco, 3MTT, MTN Academy, ALX, and personal studies, I’ve built a solid foundation in coding and technology. I thrive in environments where innovation and collaboration drive growth. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer, creating user-friendly solutions and contributing to impactful projects. I’m eager to apply my knowledge, grow with a team, and make a difference through code.
